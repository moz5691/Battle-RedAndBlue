## Scope

Create a 2-person online game in which players can launch projectiles at each other to win. If a player is hit, their character respawns with a faster projectile speed and the surviving player is given a point. Players should be able to fly in all directions to avoid projectiles. If two projectiles collide, they will explode causing area damage. 

## MVP

1. As a user, I want to be able to access a specific game instance with another player.

2. As a user, I want to be able to move in all directions on the screen and fire projectiles at my opponent.

3. As a user, I want my projectile speed to increase with every respawn after being hit.

4. As a user, I want users to die and respawn after they are hit with my projectiles. 

5. As a user, I want the game to end when any player is hit with a projectile 10 times.


### Additonal Functionality
6. As a user, I want to be able to play with more than 2 players. 

7. As a user, I want to be able to play the game with another person locally, on the same machine.
